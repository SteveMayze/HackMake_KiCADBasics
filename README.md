# Hack & Make KiCAD Basics
The project files developed for the Hack &amp; Make Nuremberg Meeting.

## Objective
This class is aimed at those who would like to create their own PCB designs but don't know where to start. 
The idea is to make a 45 minute to an hour presentation on the basics of KiCAD. It would only briefly cover 
the installation and then dive into the creation of a layout. The purpose of this approach is to demonstrate 
the following points 

1. It is possible to only create the PCB layout - but more importantly, 
1. To demonstrate why it is important to consider the workflow for board design and using KiCAD.

The presentation should cover such things as creating a circuit, association footprints to the symbols and 
then formally creating the layout again with the support of the software.

## The Repository
This repository will contain the files developed to support the presentation. There are two models. One for 
the first part of the presentation. This is a reference model as it is envisaged to create this model from scratch
durint the presentation. The second model is distributed over several directories. Each representing specific 
steps. The idea here is as follows

1. Provides neat falback points
1. Although envisaged as a presentation, there could be participants that want to follow along. This provides
the artifacts so that they can pick up at the current spot in the presentation rather than loosing the thread
of the presentation because of catching up.

The first model is a simple LED, resistor and battery circuit. As mentioned earlier, this will be created 
on the fly, from scratch. The second model will be a "Blinky" based on the 555 timer. The details of the 
circuit won't be discussed. 

## What needs to be covered

1. Menu Layout - The important points
1. Program Navigation - The various modules
1. Schematic Editor
   1. The Symbol Editor
1. The PCB Layout tool
   1. Hotkeys
   1. The footprint editor
   1. The 3D viewer
   1. The Gerber viewer
